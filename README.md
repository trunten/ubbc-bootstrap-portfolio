# Portfolio Page Challenge

## Description
- I was given the task of recreating my personal portfolio of work using the [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) framework.
- The page highlights my strongest work, using bootstrap cards, linking to deployed web applications.
- The site has been developed using bootstrap with additional CSS styling overrides.
- The page presents my name, an avatar and in-page links to to the following sections:
  - About
  - Projects
  - Skills
  - Contact links
- There is a bootstrap navigation menu that is fixed to the top of the page that collapses at smaller screen sizes. The links in the navigation scroll to the corresponding section when clicked.
- There is a "scroll to top button" fixed in the lower right corner of the page.
- The projects section contains titled images of my projects/applications with the first application's image displaying larger in size than the others.
- Buttons to the deployed application appear, overlayed on the project card's image, when the user hovers over a project card.
- When the buttons in the project cards are clicked the user is taken to that deployed application in a new browser tab/window (entire card is also clickable).
- The site is made responsive using bootstrap columns which adapt to the user viewport.
- The site contains bootstrap progress bars displaying the percentage of various coding languages that have been utilised in my projects; updates automatically from GitHub using the GitHub API.
